# YT_TimeManagerSystem

## Philosophy
This plugin provides a lightweight, extensible framework for in-game time management, including days, day-night cycles, and the foundation for more complex time-based systems. The goal is to keep the setup minimal and avoid over-engineering, allowing for easy expansion as needed.

- **Core Purpose:** Track in-game time, days, and support day-night cycles.
- **Extensible:** Designed to be expanded with seasons, weather, or time-based events in the future.
- **Minimal Setup:** No implementations or game logic included by defaultâ€”just the scaffolding for a time system.

> **Note:** This plugin is intentionally left light. Add your own systems and logic as your project requires!
